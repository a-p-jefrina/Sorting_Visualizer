                <h2>About Sorting Visualizer</h2>
                <p>
                    Sorting Visualizer is a web-based tool that allows you to visualize how different sorting algorithms work. 
    It animates the sorting process in real-time, making it easier to understand the algorithms' behavior and performance.
                </p>

                <h2>How does it works</h2>
                <p>The Sorting Visualizer allows you to generate an array of elements and choose from various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, 
    Selection Sort, Insertion Sort and Quick Sort among others. You can adjust the array size and sorting speed to customize your 
    experience. When you start the sorting process, the visualizer will show the algorithm step-by-step, highlighting the elements being 
    compared and swapped with green and red color. This dynamic visualization helps in understanding the sorting algorithms' inner workings and their time and space complexity.</p>
